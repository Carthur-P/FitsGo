                <h4>30/07/2019</h4>
                <p>Meeting with the whole team to discuss two potential projects. The first project was a
                  Beyblade statistic tracking app which is going to be developed in native android and eventually ported
                  to IOS using react-native. The hardware to track the statistic of the Beyblades is going to be
                  provided by the client.<br><br>

                  The second project is an exercise application. This application is going to track the user’s current
                  location and display multiple points of interest in the region for the user to run to. If the user
                  decides to run to these locations, they will be awarded points that they can view, track and compare
                  against other people in their profile. This app is to be developed using react-native.<br><br>

                  A discussion between the three mobile project group members established that Aemon and I will be
                  working on the exercise application while Isiah will be working on the Beyblades statistic tracking
                  application. The Beyblades application will be less labour-intensive as some codes will be given to
                  the developers. Furthermore, the application is being developed in native android which all three
                  members of the project team are familiar with.<br><br>

                  Getting the react-native developing environment to work with a phone emulator at the Otago Polytech
                  site was successful. I was able to start playing around with react native codes in that environment.
                  However, trying to get the developing environment to work at home was not successful.<br><br>

                <p>Starting the project by creating issue tickets for all the individual features that the
                  application will do. This was done on GitLab so that all the team members can track and view it. Four
                  issues were also picked out to form our first sprint of the project which includes two tasks for each
                  team members. I was tasked with creating the map and adding markers to the map for the application.
                  The project workflow was also established with each individual issue having a separate developing
                  branch that will then be merged to the “dev-env” branch. This will then be merged into the master
                  branch by our project team leader. This was established to ensure that the dev-env branch is a clean
                  working production branch.

                  The problem from the previous sprint (Pre Sprint) regarding the development environment at home was
                  also solved. The problem that was causing the home developing environment error was a missing file in
                  the android app folder. The missing file called “debug.keystore” was downloaded and put into the
                  specified folder.<br><br>

                  An error was encountered where the MapView component has been made to create the map in the
                  application, however the view refuses to show up in the application.
                </p>
                <h4>07/08/2019</h4>

                  The map can now be seen by changing the styling of the containers that contain the MapView component.
                  The container that contains the MapView component has to be set to an absolute position.

                  A quick wireframe was made of all the screens that will be completed by the end of the first sprint.
                  These showcase the login screen, sign up screen and a screen showing the map to the user. This was
                  done so we can start planning the navigation between different screens and the logical layout require
                  to move between the screens. This also gives us a brief visual representation of how our application
                  is going to be structured.

                <p class="mb-5">We decided to change our developing environment both at the Otago polytechnic site and
                  our home site. Instead of using the react cli which we found slow and prone to breaking when moving
                  work between the two developing sites, we decided to migrate our developing environment and use react
                  expo instead. This method is easier to install on both sites and is less prone to creating an error
                  when moving work between different sites. Furthermore, this method allows us to test the application
                  on two different platforms, IOS and Android, using real devices that we both own. A new branch was
                  created by me and then merged to the dev-env branch once our old project has been ported to the newly
                  created expo project.</p>

                  Sprint 2 was also created which will end on the 26/08/2019 and includes 5 features that must be
                  completed by the date. Aemon will continue to work on the login and signup features of the application
                  while I will continue working on the map features of the application.

                  Started working on feature 11 which will require working with the firebase database. This feature will
                  display different running location to the user which are loaded from the database. Using online
                  resources, I was able to config the database and fetch data from it which was then used to form
                  different markers on the map. This feature was completed without much trouble or errors.

                  Researching about react-native geofencing features that can be used to implement geofencing on the
                  exercise application. Two possible ways of implementing geofencing were radius from a specified point
                  and point in a polygon geofence. I decided to implement the point in a polygon geofence method which
                  meant that we could customize the shape and size of the geofence to suit our requirement of the
                  geofence being each suburbs in Dunedin. Using the radius from a specified point will mean that we
                  could not customize the shape of the geofence to the shape we wanted, leading to a less accurate
                  geofence. The attempt to implement geofencing in our application proved very difficult as multiple
                  libraries were used which all failed. The most promising libraries that did not cause a fatal
                  application error was called “react-native-geo-fencing”. A method in this library takes in two
                  arguments, one being the actual point that is going to be tested, and two being an array of points
                  that will form the geofence polygon. However, this method always returns a negative finding even
                  though the point is in the polygon.

                  Further research shows that many people have encountered the same problem as the library is outdated
                  and has not been worked on for nearly two years. Other libraries were utilized to try and implement
                  geofencing features into the app. However, all failed. Finally, I came across a thread which contained
                  a self-written method that will take in two arguments similar to the method in the
                  “react-native-geo-fencing” library and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the point is inside
                  the set of points forming the polygon. This method was implemented into the code and geofencing
                  functionality was achieved in the application.<br><br>

                  Sprint 2 was closed with all the features on the sprint being completed. Some new issues
                  were created including a new label for bug issues. This was created to indicate that the issue is a
                  bug in the application that will need to be fixed but not actually a new feature for the application.
                  The latest build of the application contains a few bugs which mostly relates to android layouts not
                  working on IOS or native IOS features not working on android devices. Important bugs were added as
                  tasks that need to be completed in sprint 3. Sprint 3 consists of mostly map features that will form
                  the functionality of the application itself. Each member is tasked with completing two features and a
                  bug each. The sprint is set to end on the 05/09/2019 allowing the team a week and a half to work on
                  these features. Contact was also made with the client both to initiate rapport and clarifying a
                  feature of the app. The feature that required further clarification was the markers clustering
                  feature.

                  The bug where the map on the IOS device only shows on half of the screen is a pressing issue as this
                  affect how the user using IOS devices interreacts with the application. This bug was caused by using
                  the android drawer instead of a third-party drawer code or native drawer codes. This will need to be
                  fixed urgently in the sprint.

                  Extra polygons were created on the maps making four different regions. Drawers feature was also fixed
                  on IOS version of the app which meant that the bug where the map only showed on half of the screen on
                  IOS was also solved. This was done by using the react-native drawer instead of android drawer.

                  Doing some research on react native map clustering. Clustering codes were also added to the
                  application. However, the clustering feature was laggy and did not suit the functionality of our
                  application. Our app requires clustering base on specific regions identifies by polygons on the map.
                  However, all the clustering libraries only cluster marker when the markers are too close to each
                  other. This could not be modified to suit the functionality that we required. Further research on this
                  topic will have to be conducted.

                <p>
                  I have decided to not use any clustering library and instead used my own coding logic which will only
                  display markers in regions that the user is currently. All the other regions will have a custom marker
                  displaying how many markers are in those regions. The code for displaying only markers in the regions
                  that the user is in have been implemented however the code is not operating how it should as no
                  markers are displayed.

                  Sprint 3 ended and sprint 4 was created. Some tasks from sprint 3 were pushed or separated into other
                  features that will be completed in sprint 4. This includes the markers clustering feature which proved
                  more difficult than originally thought. This feature was mostly completed with markers in the region
                  now displaying when the user enters the regions. However, no custom markers are being displayed in
                  other regions that are not displaying any markers. The markers are also not displaying initially on
                  IOS (iPhone XS) but only displaying once the user moves. This missing feature and bug were added as
                  issues in sprint 4. Sprint 4 will only go for one week starting on the 05/09/2019 and ending on the
                  12/09/2019 as it mostly only focusses on bug fixing and improving user experience. This is due to our
                  upcoming scheduled showcasing of our application to the client. Most of the core feature of the
                  application is now operational to show to the client however minor bug fixing and improvement in the
                  UI is required before the showcase date.

                  Fixing the timer error which only occurs on android phones. Reseating shows that this is caused by the
                  real-time database firebase. However, currently, there is no fix to this problem as the React native
                  team is still currently working on the fix. The solution currently is to hide the yellow box warning
                  which is not a major error to the application.

                  Fixing the error where markers did not display when the map initially loads. This was due to the
                  firebase data fetching taking longer than it takes for the map to render. However, using the
                  react-native lifecycle pattern still did not solve this problem. The solution came when the code to
                  fetch the markers to display was inserted in the callback function of the data fetching method. This
                  forces the marker fetching function to be called only when the data is completely fetched from
                  firebase.

                  Contacting the client to establish a meeting time with her so we can show her the prototype of the
                  application. Contact was made through email and the conclusion was the meeting is going to be
                  conducted on Wednesday the 18th of September.

                  Meeting with the client to discuss the application prototype. She was pleased with how the app is
                  functioning so far. Majority of the key features that we have developed so far was met with positive
                  reviews by the client. Some additional feature was established which includes collecting markers,
                  showing collected markers on profile and friend connectivity which will allow the user to compete with
                  their friends. The meeting showed that our idea of the application and the idea of the client for the
                  application is aligned.

                  A bug occurred in our IOS build of the application where all our polygon regions colour was changed to
                  its default blue. This only occurred on the IOS version of the application while the android version
                  functions the same without change. Further research showed that this is a bug within react-native
                  itself and a lot of different developers are having the same problem. A workaround may have to be
                  implemented, but for now, we will leave it in hope that the react-native team will fix this bug.

                  Another bug was also discovered on the login screen. When the user I prompt with the login screen, the
                  user can press back or swipe back to show the application homepage. This meant that they could bypass
                  the sign-in screen altogether. This is due to a lack of verification while signing in but rather only
                  using navigation to prompt the user with the sign-in screen. This is a major issue regarding security
                  if the application is live. This bug will have to be fixed as soon as possible and is a priority fix.

                  Sprint 5 came to an end with most of the task being completed. Some minor tasks which mostly concerns
                  the design of the application were pushed to a later sprint as it was not a high priority issue.
                  Multiple issues were added to the project board. These issues included new feature that was added by
                  the client during our meeting and also multiple bugs that were found during the development of the
                  app. A new label was also added called extra, which is used for extra features, UI fixes or life
                  improvement fixes that do not need to be done but would be good to accomplish.

                  A new user is created when the user signs in with Google for the first time. This user includes first
                  name, last name and profile picture from google. However, the date of birth and weight will have to be
                  set by the user in the profile section as this information cannot be obtained from google. There is
                  still a persisting bug that does not allow the user to instantly access the profile page when they
                  first sign up or sign in with google. The profile page shows briefly then immediately gets redirected
                  to the homepage. This bug will have to be further investigated if there is time after completing other
                  more important features and issue.

                  Creating a function that will only show the selected marker when the timer is started. This required
                  passing data from the parent class to the child class. This was able to be done using props and a
                  passed-in function. However, there is a bug with the function. The function does not show any markers
                  when the timer starts even though the function returns a marker which can be console log from outside
                  the function. Further investigation is required to fix this problem.

                  Adding extra label to the last three issues which concern the friend's connectivity features and
                  weekly challenges. This is because these features will only be done if there is extra time to
                  accomplished them. These features are complicated features which will require some time to
                  accomplished while there are more pressing features that need to be fixed. Hence why these features
                  have been allocated to extra features that will be completed if there is time.

                <p>
                  Only selected markers now show up when the user starts the timer. The bug was fixed through using the
                  map function to loop through the array of fetched firebase data. Since there is only one item in the
                  fetch data due to fetching the data using a query on the marker’s title, there will only be one marker
                  displayed to the user which will be the selected marker. However, even though there is only one
                  fetched data, the map function still had to be used in order to get the correct marker information
                  that MapView markers will accept. This is why the marker did not initially display using the previous
                  method.

                  There was a merged conflict on the latest merged request submitted by Aemon. This was easily resolved,
                  however the merged cause an error when the user stops the timer. The parent callback function to
                  determine if the timer in the workout component is going did not seem to be getting called. This meant
                  that the method calling for all the markers to be displayed did not get called causing the whole
                  application to crash. This was fixed by moving the stop timer method in the workout class to be called
                  first.

                  The feature where “collected markers” are shown in the record page proves more difficult than
                  originally thought. This feature requires geofencing features to prove that the user is close to the
                  selected markers they have run to, in order to collect the marker and display it on their record.
                  However, multiple geofencing libraries have been used which has all failed. This was the same problem
                  that was encountered during the development of the region geofencing feature. It seems that most
                  libraries are out of date or are not compatible with expo workflow. Some of the libraries erroring has
                  been shown below.

                  Due to the time constraints, I have decided to not implement the geofencing feature for verifying if
                  the user is near the selected marker they wanted to run to. This means that if the user decide to stop
                  the timer before reaching the marker. The marker will still be added to their record. This feature
                  will be implemented if there is enough time once all the other features and bug fixing is
                  accomplished. Further research will also have to be conducted to find and implement a geofencing
                  library that works. For now the geofencing feature for the marker is added as an extra issue

                  Sprint 7 came to a close with all tasks being completed. This sprint mostly focuses on bug fixing/app
                  optimization alongside some features that will improve the user’s UI. Documentation was also apart of
                  this sprint with the README.MD file being updated to show the user how to use the application. This is
                  the last sprint of the development cycle and the application is at its final stage which will be given
                  then showcased by the client at her presentation. Most of the main features that the client has asked
                  for are all completed. There are certain features such as the friend's connectivity and weekly
                  challenges that were not able to be completed in time. If we had more time to complete another sprint,
                  these tasks would have been able to be accomplished and implemented into the application. Overall the
                  application meets all the main requirements that the client has tasked us with and the missing
                  features were extra requirements that the client would have liked but did not require.
